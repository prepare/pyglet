Most features of pyglet should work just fine with Python 3, but there may still be
many bugs. Bug reports and patches are welcome.


To use pyglet with Python 3.x, the source code has to be converted using 2to3.
When pyglet is installed using "python setup.py install" this happens automatically.

The converted version of pyglet is currently known to work on Windows and Linux, it
might not work on MacOS (needs testing).

--------------------

All tests are now py2/3 compatible.

Futurize stage 1 has been applied to the whole pyglet package. Next step is to apply stage 2.

Stage 2 applied to:
- pyglet.app
- pyglet.canvas
- pyglet.font
